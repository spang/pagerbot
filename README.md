PagerBot [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/spang/pagerbot) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stripe-contrib/pagerbot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stripe-contrib/pagerbot)
========

Pagerbot is a bot that makes managing [PagerDuty](http://www.pagerduty.com/) on-call schedules easier. It currently supports IRC and Slack, and can be easily deployed to Heroku. 

Pagerbot uses [Chronic](https://github.com/mojombo/chronic) for natural language date and time parsing.

Usage
======

The easiest way to get started is to use the Heroku button above to launch an admin interface for pagerbot, where you need to fill out a few API keys and choose commands (plugins) that pagerbot knows about and responds to.

Going through the admin page shouldn't take much longer than 8 minutes. The admin page also contains detailed information on how to make the bot join your channel.

To start up the admin interface again, rescale the dynos to have a single web worker and remove the DEPLOYED config variable in heroku dashboard.

Plugins
=======

Currently pagerbot supports the following commands (prefix all of them with bot name and a colon, e.g. `pagerbot:`):

| Plugin | Example | Notes |
| ----------------- |:---------------------------------------------------:| -----|
| - | `help` | Short list of all commands pagerbot knows. |
| - | `manual` | Show in-depth explanation about each command. |
| - | `who is on primary now?` | Find out who is on a specific schedule at time. |
| - | `when am I on product?` | Find out who is on a specific schedule at time. |
| Schedule override | `put me on triage for 30 minutes` | Overrides the current schedule for a duration. |
| Schedule override | `put carl on primary from 3 AM until 4 AM August 24th` | |
| Call | `call sys because admin server is acting funky` | Send email to \<teamname\>\<email-suffix\>, where email-suffix is set in admin. |
| Call person | `get andrew because we need to credential people` | Triggers an pagerduty issue for person. |
| Switch shift | `put amy on triage during carl's shift on August 11th` | Take over a single shift on a specific day. |
| Reload | `reload` | Load user and schedule changes from pagerduty. |
| Add Alias | `alias karl@mycompany.com as karl` | Add a new alias for person or schedule. |

Local development
=============

You will need ruby with bundle, as well as a running instance of mongodb running on port 27017.

Fork and clone this repository and open it in a console.

```bash
# running tests
rake test

# running the admin interface
bundle exec ruby lib/pagerbot.rb admin

# run irc bot locally (after setting up bot in admin)
bundle exec ruby lib/pagerbot.rb admin irc
```

To deploy it to heroku, git clone, create a heroku app and push to launch it.
```bash
heroku create
heroku addons:add mongolab:sandbox
git push heroku master
```

For developing new capabilities, PagerDuty has two different APIs:

* The [Integration API](https://developer.pagerduty.com/documentation/integration/events) is a high-availability endpoint for triggering and updating incidents.
* The [REST API](https://developer.pagerduty.com/documentation/rest) provides CRUD for most PagerDuty account objects, such as users, schedules, escalation policies, etc

FAQ
====

### Heroku is asking for my credit card! Do I need to pay for this?
No, running your own pagerbot is free! This is a requirement of the free MongoDB add-on. See the [verification policy of Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/account-verification#verification-requirement).

### How can I secure the admin interface?

Set the enviroment variable called `PROTECT_ADMIN` to be your desired password. Instructions for changing an enviroment variable are listed in the next FAQ.

When using the admin interface, enter the same password, the username can be arbitrary.

### How can I relaunch the admin interface?

Via web: 
* [Log into heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) and navigate to your application. 
* **If it's a slackbot:** go to settings and remove DEPLOYED config variable.
* **If it's an irc bot:** rescale your application to have 1 web worker and 0 irc workers.

Via command line:
* **If it's a slackbot:** `heroku config:set DEPLOYED=false`
* **If it's an irc bot:** `heroku ps:scale web=1 irc=0`
